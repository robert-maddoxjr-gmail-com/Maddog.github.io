<p>This website is about arterial blood gas interpretation.
It is a Graduate Student Web Project and is not to be taken as instructional, or educational.</p>
<p>Definition</P>
<p> Arterial blood gases (ABGs) is a term that is applied to three different measurements  - pH, Pco2 (Partial Pressure of Carbon Dioxide) 
and Po2 (Partial Pressure of oxygen).  
These measurements together evaluate the acid-base status, ventilation, and arterial oxygenation of the human
body.

Oxygen and carbon dioxide are extremely important respiratory gases and their partial pressures in arterial 
blood reflect the overall adequacy of gas exchange in the lungs.  The partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (Pao2) is affected by age
and altitude. This is cause to evaluate Pao2 individually for each patient and both determinations should be 
interpreted against local normal values. </p> 

<p> Hydrogen is not present in the blood as a gas so it does not create a partial pressure.  But, pH, measures hydrogen ion
activity and is a conventional part of every arterial blood gas determination.  The normal range for blood pH
is 7.35 to 7.45. derived variables that can be drawn from ABGs can include bicarbonate concentration which is calculated 
from the pH and the Pco2 and is the most useful of derived variables. </p> 

<p> Technique</p>
<p>

Accurate results for ABGs depend on collecting, handling, and analyzing the specimen correctly.  Clinically important 
errors can happen anywhere along these steps but, ABG measurements are particularly sensitive to preanalytic errors.
